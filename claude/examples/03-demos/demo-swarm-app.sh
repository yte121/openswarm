# Weather CLI

A simple weather CLI application created by the Claude Flow Swarm system.

## Swarm Creation Details

This application was created through the collaborative effort of multiple swarm agents:

- **Developer-1**: Implemented the core functionality
- **Tester-1**: Created the test suite
- **Documenter-1**: Generated this documentation

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
# Get weather for default location (New York)
node index.js

# Get weather for specific location
node index.js San Francisco

# Show swarm creation info
node index.js --info
```

## How This Was Created

The Claude Flow Swarm system decomposed the objective "create a weather CLI app" into the following tasks:

1. **Analyze Requirements** - Understood the need for a CLI weather application
2. **Create Implementation** - Built the core Node.js application
3. **Write Tests** - Created test suite to verify functionality
4. **Create Documentation** - Generated this README and inline docs

Each task was assigned to specialized agents that worked in coordination to produce this application.

## Architecture

```
weather-cli/
├── index.js      # Main CLI application
├── test.js       # Test suite
├── package.json  # NPM configuration
└── README.md     # This documentation
```

## Swarm Benefits

This application demonstrates several benefits of the swarm approach:

- **Parallel Development**: Multiple agents work on different aspects simultaneously
- **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on their area of expertise
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing and documentation
- **Consistency**: Follows established patterns and best practices
