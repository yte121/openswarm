cd swarm-created-app/

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the application
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Development mode
npm run dev
```

## What Makes These Special

These aren't templates or boilerplate - each application was:
1. **Conceived** by analyzing the objective
2. **Designed** through agent collaboration
3. **Implemented** with clean code practices
4. **Tested** with comprehensive test suites
5. **Documented** for easy understanding

The swarm system demonstrates it can create production-ready applications that developers would be proud to ship.
