# Task Manager CLI

A command-line task management application created by the Claude Flow Swarm system.

## Swarm Creation Process

This application was created through coordinated effort of multiple swarm agents:

### Agent Contributions

1. **Coordinator-1**: Decomposed the objective into subtasks
2. **Developer-1**: Implemented the core TaskManager class
3. **Developer-2**: Created the CLI interface
4. **Tester-1**: Developed comprehensive test suite
5. **Documenter-1**: Generated this documentation

### Task Execution Timeline

```
[00:00] Objective received: "create task manager with CRUD operations"
[00:01] Task decomposition completed (5 subtasks identified)
[00:02] Agents assigned to tasks
[00:05] Core implementation completed
[00:07] CLI interface completed
[00:09] Test suite completed
[00:10] Documentation completed
[00:11] Quality review passed
```

## Features

- Add tasks with priority levels
- List all tasks with status indicators
- Mark tasks as completed
- View task statistics
- Swarm agent attribution for each operation

## Installation

```bash
# No installation needed - it's a standalone Node.js application
node task-manager.js --help
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Add a new task
node task-manager.js add "Review pull request"

# List all tasks
node task-manager.js list

# Complete a task
node task-manager.js complete 1

# View statistics
node task-manager.js stats
```

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture designed by the swarm:

```
TaskManager (Core Class)
    ├── Task Management
    │   ├── addTask()
    │   ├── listTasks()
    │   └── completeTask()
    └── Analytics
        └── getStats()
```

## Testing

Run the test suite created by Tester-1:

```bash
node task-manager.test.js
```

## Swarm Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Parallel Development**: Multiple agents worked simultaneously
2. **Specialization**: Each agent focused on their expertise
3. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing and documentation
4. **Rapid Development**: Complete application in minutes
5. **Best Practices**: Follows coding standards and patterns
