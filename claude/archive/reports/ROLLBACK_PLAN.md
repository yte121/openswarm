# Production Deployment Rollback Plan

**Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Branch:** feature/ruv-swarm-mcp-integration  
**Status:** BLOCKED - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION  

## Critical Issues Identified

### üö® BLOCKING ISSUES
1. **TypeScript Compilation Failures**
   - Location: `src/agents/agent-manager.ts`
   - Issue: Type mismatches in event handlers
   - Impact: Build cannot complete

2. **Missing Core Dependency**
   - Package: `ruv-swarm`
   - Issue: Module not found in node_modules
   - Impact: Core integration functionality broken

3. **Test Suite Failures**
   - Jest tests failing in optimization modules
   - MCP integration tests broken
   - ES module compatibility issues

4. **Linting Configuration Missing**
   - No ESLint configuration found
   - Code quality validation impossible

## Deployment Verdict: ‚ùå NOT READY

This integration branch is **not ready for production deployment** due to critical compilation errors and missing dependencies that would break the system.

## Rollback Strategy

### Option 1: Fix Forward (Recommended)
```bash
# Stay on integration branch and fix issues
git checkout feature/ruv-swarm-mcp-integration

# Fix TypeScript errors first
# Fix dependency resolution
# Fix test compatibility

# Then rerun deployment validation
```

### Option 2: Emergency Rollback to Main
```bash
# If immediate rollback needed
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Only if safe
```

### Option 3: Create Hotfix Branch
```bash
# For critical fixes while maintaining integration work
git checkout -b hotfix/production-ready main
# Cherry-pick only stable commits
```

## Pre-Deployment Requirements

### ‚úÖ Must Complete Before Deploy
- [ ] Fix TypeScript compilation errors in agent-manager.ts
- [ ] Resolve ruv-swarm dependency installation
- [ ] Fix Jest test configuration and module imports
- [ ] Add ESLint configuration for code quality
- [ ] Verify all integration tests pass
- [ ] Run security audit on production dependencies
- [ ] Performance benchmarks within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Documentation updated for new features

### üîç Additional Checks Needed
- [ ] Load testing with swarm coordination
- [ ] Memory leak testing for neural agents
- [ ] WASM module compatibility verification
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (Linux/macOS/Windows)

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk Areas:**
- Agent coordination system
- Memory management with TTL
- MCP server integration
- WASM module loading

**Low Risk Areas:**
- CLI command structure
- Configuration management
- Documentation updates
- Example applications

## Monitoring Requirements

If deployment proceeds after fixes:
- Monitor agent spawn/termination rates
- Track memory usage patterns
- Watch for MCP connection failures
- Monitor TypeScript compilation in CI/CD
