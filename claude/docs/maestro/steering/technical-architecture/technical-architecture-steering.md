# Technical-architecture Steering Document

*Created: 2025-07-29 | Template: technical*

## Overview
This steering document provides comprehensive guidance for the **technical-architecture** domain, ensuring consistency and quality across all related development activities.

## Guiding Principles
Technical architecture guidelines for scalable, maintainable systems with microservices patterns.

## Technical Standards

### Core Standards
- Follow established architectural patterns and design principles
- Maintain consistency with existing system architecture
- Implement proper error handling and logging throughout
- Use dependency injection and inversion of control

### Code Quality Requirements
- Maintain >95% test coverage for critical components
- Follow established coding standards and conventions
- Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Document all public APIs and complex business logic

## Architecture Guidelines

### Architectural Decisions
- Service-oriented architecture with clear boundaries
- Event-driven communication between services
- Microservices pattern for scalable components
- Consistent data modeling and persistence strategies

### Design Patterns
- Repository pattern for data access
- Factory pattern for object creation
- Observer pattern for event handling
- Strategy pattern for configurable behavior

## Implementation Practices

### Development Practices
- Test-driven development (TDD) for critical functionality
- Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)
- Code review requirements for all changes
- Automated quality gates and validation

### Implementation Guidelines
- Clean code principles and SOLID design
- Proper exception handling and recovery
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Security-first development approach

## Quality Gates

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- Performance benchmarking and load testing
- Security vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
- Code quality metrics and technical debt tracking

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate

## Steering Context Integration

### Agent Guidance
When AI agents work on technical-architecture-related tasks:
- Apply the principles and standards defined in this document
- Validate implementations against these guidelines
- Escalate any conflicts or ambiguities for human review
- Document decisions and rationale for future reference

### Workflow Integration
- Requirements gathering should reference these standards
- Design decisions must align with architectural guidelines
- Implementation must follow coding standards and practices
- Testing must meet quality gates and validation criteria

## Compliance and Validation

### Automated Checks
- Code quality tools and linters configured
- Security scanning integrated into CI/CD
- Performance monitoring and alerting active
- Documentation generation and validation automated

### Manual Reviews
- Architecture review for significant changes
- Security review for sensitive components
- Performance review for critical paths
- User experience review for interface changes
