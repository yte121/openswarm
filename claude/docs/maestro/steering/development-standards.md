# Development Standards - Maestro Steering Document

## Overview

This steering document establishes development standards and best practices for the Maestro specifications-driven development framework, ensuring consistency, quality, and maintainability across all implementations.

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Standards
- **Strict Mode**: All TypeScript must use strict mode compilation
- **Type Safety**: No `any` types without explicit justification
- **Interface Definitions**: All public APIs must have complete interface definitions
- **Generic Usage**: Use generics for reusable components and utilities

### Code Organization
- **File Size**: Maximum 1000 lines per file (exceptions require justification)
- **Function Complexity**: Maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10
- **Class Design**: Single responsibility principle with clear boundaries
- **Import Organization**: Logical grouping with external, internal, and relative imports

### Documentation Requirements
- **JSDoc**: All public methods and classes must have JSDoc comments
- **README Files**: Each module must have comprehensive README
- **Type Documentation**: Complex types must include usage examples
- **Architecture Decisions**: Document significant design choices

## Testing Standards

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 90% line coverage for core logic
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints and workflows
- **Error Handling**: Test all error conditions and edge cases
- **Performance Tests**: Critical path performance benchmarks

### Test Organization
- **Test Structure**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- **Test Naming**: Descriptive names indicating intent and expected outcome
- **Mock Usage**: Strategic mocking for external dependencies
- **Data-Driven Tests**: Use parameterized tests for multiple scenarios

## Error Handling Standards

### Error Types
- **SystemError**: For system-level failures and infrastructure issues
- **ValidationError**: For input validation and constraint violations
- **BusinessLogicError**: For domain-specific rule violations
- **TimeoutError**: For operation timeouts and deadline failures

### Error Recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures in distributed operations
- **Logging**: Comprehensive error context for debugging

## Performance Standards

### Response Time Requirements
- **CLI Commands**: < 200ms for status and query operations
- **Specification Creation**: < 2 seconds for file generation
- **Design Generation**: < 2 minutes with hive mind collective intelligence
- **Task Implementation**: < 30 seconds average execution time

### Resource Usage
- **Memory Growth**: < 5% per hour for long-running processes
- **File System**: Efficient file I/O with proper cleanup
- **Network Usage**: Minimize API calls with intelligent caching
- **CPU Usage**: Non-blocking operations for UI responsiveness

## Security Standards

### Input Validation
- **Sanitization**: All user inputs must be sanitized
- **Path Traversal**: Prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Command Injection**: Sanitize all shell command execution
- **Type Validation**: Runtime type checking for external data

### File System Security
- **Path Restrictions**: Limit file operations to designated directories
- **Permission Checks**: Verify file permissions before operations
- **Secure Cleanup**: Ensure temporary files are properly removed
- **Access Logging**: Log all file system operations

## Integration Standards

### Hive Mind Integration
- **Timeout Management**: All hive mind operations must have timeouts
- **Error Isolation**: Hive mind failures don't break core functionality
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion from collective operations
- **State Management**: Maintain workflow state independently

### Hook System Integration
- **Error Isolation**: Hook failures don't interrupt main workflow
- **Performance**: Hooks execute asynchronously where possible
- **Priority Management**: Critical hooks have higher priority
- **Cleanup**: Proper hook cleanup on system shutdown

## Workflow Standards

### Specification Creation
- **Template Compliance**: Use standardized templates for all specifications
- **EARS Notation**: Requirements must follow EARS syntax
- **Validation**: Validate all generated specifications before saving
- **Version Control**: Track specification changes and history

### Design Generation
- **Collective Intelligence**: Prefer hive mind for complex design decisions
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful fallback to agent manager when needed
- **Quality Gates**: Design must pass quality checks before approval
- **Architecture Review**: Complex designs require architecture review

### Task Implementation
- **Dependency Management**: Clear task dependencies and ordering
- **Consensus Validation**: Use consensus for critical implementation decisions
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates and status reporting
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated quality checks throughout implementation

## Documentation Standards

### Specification Documents
- **Requirements**: EARS notation with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Design**: Architecture, components, APIs, security, and performance
- **Tasks**: Ordered task breakdown with implementation guidance
- **Completeness**: All three files required for feature completion

### Code Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI specifications for all endpoints
- **Usage Examples**: Practical examples for all public interfaces
- **Migration Guides**: Clear migration paths for breaking changes
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and resolution strategies

## Deployment Standards

### Environment Management
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific configuration management
- **Secrets**: Secure secret management and rotation
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Backup**: Regular backup of specifications and workflow state

### Release Management
- **Version Control**: Semantic versioning for all releases
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before production deployment
- **Rollback**: Quick rollback capability for failed deployments
- **Documentation**: Release notes and upgrade instructions

## Compliance and Governance

### Code Review Requirements
- **Peer Review**: All code changes require peer review
- **Architecture Review**: Significant changes require architecture review
- **Security Review**: Security-sensitive changes require security review
- **Performance Review**: Performance-critical changes require performance review

### Quality Gates
- **Automated Testing**: All tests pass before merge
- **Code Coverage**: Maintain minimum coverage thresholds
- **Static Analysis**: Pass all static analysis checks
- **Security Scanning**: Pass security vulnerability scans

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics Collection
- **Performance Metrics**: Collect and analyze system performance data
- **Usage Analytics**: Track feature usage and adoption patterns
- **Error Rates**: Monitor and analyze error patterns
- **User Feedback**: Collect and act on user feedback

### Process Improvement
- **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly review of development standards
- **Best Practice Updates**: Incorporate industry best practices
- **Tool Evaluation**: Evaluate and adopt improved development tools
- **Training**: Regular training on standards and best practices
