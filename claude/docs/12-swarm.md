# Swarm Mode - Self-Orchestrating Agent Networks

## Overview

Swarm mode enables Claude to act as a master orchestrator, automatically spawning and coordinating multiple specialized sub-agents to achieve complex objectives. This advanced feature allows for autonomous, self-organizing AI teams that can tackle large-scale projects.

## Key Concepts

### Master Orchestrator
The primary Claude instance that:
- Analyzes objectives and creates execution plans
- Spawns specialized agents as needed
- Manages task dependencies and coordination
- Monitors progress and adjusts strategies
- Synthesizes results from all agents

### Agent Types
- **Researcher**: Information gathering, web research, analysis
- **Developer**: Code implementation, testing, debugging
- **Analyst**: Data analysis, pattern recognition, insights
- **Reviewer**: Code review, quality assurance, validation
- **Coordinator**: Sub-task coordination, dependency management

### Orchestration Strategies
- **Auto**: Automatically determine the best approach
- **Research**: Focus on research and information gathering
- **Development**: Focus on implementation and coding
- **Analysis**: Focus on analysis and insights

## Command Usage

### Basic Syntax
```bash
claude-flow swarm <objective> [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--strategy` | `-s` | Orchestration strategy (auto, research, development, analysis) | `auto` |
| `--max-agents` | | Maximum number of agents to spawn | `5` |
| `--max-depth` | | Maximum delegation depth | `3` |
| `--research` | | Enable research capabilities for all agents | `false` |
| `--parallel` | | Enable parallel execution | `false` |
| `--memory-namespace` | | Shared memory namespace | `swarm` |
| `--timeout` | | Swarm timeout in minutes | `60` |
| `--review` | | Enable peer review between agents | `false` |
| `--coordinator` | | Spawn dedicated coordinator agent | `false` |
| `--config` | `-c` | MCP config file | |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Enable verbose output | `false` |
| `--dry-run` | `-d` | Preview swarm configuration | `false` |

## Examples

### Basic Swarm
```bash
claude-flow swarm "Build a complete e-commerce platform with React and Node.js"
```

### Research-Focused Swarm
```bash
claude-flow swarm "Research and document best practices for microservices architecture" \
  --strategy research \
  --research \
  --max-agents 8
```

### Development Swarm with Review
```bash
claude-flow swarm "Refactor the authentication system with modern security practices" \
  --strategy development \
  --review \
  --parallel \
  --max-agents 6
```

### Complex Project with Coordinator
```bash
claude-flow swarm "Migrate monolithic application to microservices" \
  --coordinator \
  --max-depth 4 \
  --timeout 120 \
  --review
```

### Dry Run to Preview
```bash
claude-flow swarm "Create mobile app" --dry-run --verbose
```

## How It Works

### 1. Objective Analysis
The master orchestrator receives the objective and:
- Breaks it down into major components
- Identifies required skills and resources
- Determines optimal agent composition
- Creates a hierarchical task structure

### 2. Agent Spawning
Based on the analysis, the orchestrator:
- Spawns specialized agents with appropriate tools
- Assigns specific responsibilities to each agent
- Sets up communication channels
- Establishes task dependencies

### 3. Task Distribution
The orchestrator manages work distribution:
- Assigns tasks based on agent capabilities
- Monitors workload balance
- Handles task handoffs
- Manages parallel execution when enabled

### 4. Coordination & Communication
Throughout execution:
- Agents share discoveries via memory namespace
- Progress updates flow to the orchestrator
- Dependencies are automatically managed
- Peer reviews occur if enabled

### 5. Result Synthesis
As tasks complete:
- Results are collected and validated
- The orchestrator synthesizes findings
- Final deliverables are assembled
- Summary report is generated

## Memory Coordination

All agents in a swarm share a memory namespace, enabling:
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Discoveries are immediately available to all agents
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Agents avoid redundant work
- **Context Building**: Each agent builds on others' findings
- **Progress Tracking**: Centralized view of swarm progress

## Advanced Features

### Delegation Depth
The `--max-depth` option controls how many levels of sub-agents can be created:
- Depth 1: Only the master orchestrator
- Depth 2: Master can spawn agents
- Depth 3: Agents can spawn sub-agents
- Depth 4+: Deep hierarchical structures

### Peer Review
When `--review` is enabled:
- Agents review each other's work
- Quality checks occur automatically
- Feedback loops improve outputs
- Final results have higher quality

### Parallel Execution
With `--parallel` flag:
- Independent tasks run simultaneously
- Resource utilization is maximized
- Total execution time is reduced
- Coordination overhead increases

### Dedicated Coordinator
The `--coordinator` option:
- Spawns a specialized coordination agent
- Handles complex dependency management
- Optimizes resource allocation
- Manages inter-agent communication

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Objectives
- Be specific about desired outcomes
- Include success criteria
- Mention any constraints or requirements

### 2. Strategy Selection
- Use `auto` for general tasks
- Choose `research` for information-heavy projects
- Select `development` for coding tasks
- Pick `analysis` for data-centric work

### 3. Resource Management
- Start with default agent limits
- Increase `--max-agents` for complex projects
- Monitor system resources during execution
- Use `--timeout` to prevent runaway swarms

### 4. Review Process
- Enable `--review` for critical projects
- Allow extra time for review cycles
- Consider peer review for quality assurance

### 5. Memory Namespace
- Use project-specific namespaces
- Clean up namespaces after completion
- Share namespaces across related swarms

## Monitoring Swarms

During execution, the master orchestrator provides regular status updates:

```
[SWARM STATUS]
- Active Agents: 4/6
- Tasks Completed: 12/20
- Current Phase: Implementation
- Next Actions: 
  - Complete user authentication module
  - Begin integration testing
  - Review API documentation
```

## Integration with Claude-Flow

Swarm mode integrates seamlessly with other Claude-Flow features:
- Uses the same persistence layer
- Shares terminal pool resources
- Leverages MCP tools
- Coordinates through EventBus

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Claude command not found"**
   - Ensure Claude CLI is installed
   - Check PATH environment variable

2. **"Maximum agents reached"**
   - Increase `--max-agents` limit
   - Simplify objective into phases

3. **"Timeout exceeded"**
   - Extend timeout with `--timeout`
   - Break objective into smaller parts

4. **"Memory namespace conflict"**
   - Use unique namespace per swarm
   - Clean up old namespaces

### Debug Mode
Use `--verbose` for detailed logging:
```bash
claude-flow swarm "debug task" --verbose --dry-run
```

## Example Workflows

### Full Stack Application
```bash
claude-flow swarm "Create a full-stack task management app with React, Node.js, PostgreSQL" \
  --strategy development \
  --max-agents 8 \
  --parallel \
  --review \
  --coordinator
```

### Research Project
```bash
claude-flow swarm "Research and compare top 10 JavaScript frameworks for enterprise applications" \
  --strategy research \
  --research \
  --max-agents 10 \
  --memory-namespace "js-frameworks"
```

### Code Migration
```bash
claude-flow swarm "Migrate legacy jQuery application to modern React with TypeScript" \
  --strategy development \
  --review \
  --max-depth 4 \
  --timeout 180
```

## Security Considerations

- Swarms inherit orchestrator's permissions
- Each agent runs with specified tools only
- Memory namespaces provide isolation
- No external data access without `--research`

## Performance Tips

1. Use `--parallel` for independent tasks
2. Limit `--max-depth` to reduce overhead
3. Set appropriate `--timeout` values
4. Monitor system resources during execution
5. Use focused strategies over `auto`

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for swarm mode:
- Visual swarm monitoring dashboard
- Dynamic agent scaling
- Cross-swarm coordination
- Swarm templates and presets
- Performance analytics

## Conclusion

Swarm mode represents the pinnacle of AI agent orchestration, enabling autonomous teams of specialized agents to tackle complex objectives. By leveraging Claude's intelligence for both execution and coordination, swarms can achieve results that would be difficult or impossible for a single agent.

Start with simple swarms and gradually increase complexity as you become familiar with the patterns and best practices. The self-organizing nature of swarms means they can often surprise you with creative solutions and efficient execution strategies.
