# Real Performance Tracking in Claude Flow

As of v2.0.0-alpha.80, Claude Flow now includes **real performance tracking** for all analysis commands. All metrics are collected from actual system operations, not simulated data.

## Overview

The performance tracking system monitors:
- **Task Execution**: Duration, success rates, and types of all executed tasks
- **Agent Performance**: Metrics for each agent type including success rates and average durations
- **System Resources**: Memory usage, CPU load, and overall system health
- **Neural Events**: Tracking of neural network operations and learning events
- **Trends Analysis**: Comparison with previous periods to identify improvements or regressions

## How It Works

### Automatic Tracking

Performance metrics are automatically collected whenever you:
- Execute any Claude Flow command
- Spawn agents
- Run swarm operations
- Perform analysis tasks

### Data Storage

Metrics are stored in `.claude-flow/metrics/`:
- `performance.json` - Overall performance statistics
- `agent-metrics.json` - Per-agent type performance data
- `task-metrics.json` - Individual task execution history
- `system-metrics.json` - System resource usage over time

## Using Real Analysis Commands

### Performance Reports

Generate comprehensive performance reports showing real metrics:

```bash
# Basic performance summary (last 24 hours)
claude-flow analysis performance-report

# Detailed report for the last week
claude-flow analysis performance-report --timeframe 7d --format detailed

# Export as JSON for further analysis
claude-flow analysis performance-report --format json

# Export as HTML for viewing in browser
claude-flow analysis performance-report --format html
```

**What's Tracked:**
- Total tasks executed
- Success rate percentage
- Average execution time
- Number of agents spawned
- Memory efficiency
- Neural learning events
- Trends compared to previous period

### Bottleneck Detection

Identify real performance bottlenecks in your system:

```bash
# System-wide bottleneck analysis
claude-flow analysis bottleneck-detect

# Agent-specific analysis
claude-flow analysis bottleneck-detect --scope agent --target coordinator

# Memory bottleneck detection
claude-flow analysis bottleneck-detect --scope memory

# Task performance analysis
claude-flow analysis bottleneck-detect --scope task
```

**What's Detected:**
- Slow tasks (>10s execution time)
- Low agent success rates (<80%)
- High memory usage (>80%)
- CPU overload conditions
- Specific recommendations for each issue

### Token Usage (Already Real)

Token usage tracking was already implemented with real data in alpha.80:

```bash
# Basic token usage
claude-flow analysis token-usage

# With breakdown by agent type
claude-flow analysis token-usage --breakdown

# With cost analysis
claude-flow analysis token-usage --breakdown --cost-analysis
```

## Metrics Collection Details

### Task Metrics

Each task execution records:
- Task ID and type
- Success/failure status
- Execution duration
- Timestamp
- Optional metadata

### Agent Metrics

For each agent type, we track:
- Total actions performed
- Success rate
- Average duration
- Recent action history
- Performance trends

### System Metrics

Collected every 30 seconds:
- Memory usage (total, used, free)
- Memory efficiency percentage
- CPU load average
- Platform information
- System uptime

## Performance Optimization Tips

Based on real metrics, the system provides:

1. **Automatic Recommendations**
   - Suggestions for slow task optimization
   - Agent pool recommendations for spawn overhead
   - Memory optimization strategies
   - CPU scaling suggestions

2. **Trend Analysis**
   - Compare current performance to previous periods
   - Identify improving or degrading metrics
   - Track the impact of optimizations

3. **Export Capabilities**
   - CSV exports for spreadsheet analysis
   - JSON exports for custom tooling
   - HTML reports for easy viewing

## Troubleshooting

### No Metrics Available

If you see no metrics:
1. Ensure you've run some commands first
2. Check `.claude-flow/metrics/` directory exists
3. Verify write permissions

### Inaccurate Metrics

Metrics accuracy improves over time:
- First 24 hours: Limited data
- After 1 week: Good trend analysis
- After 1 month: Comprehensive insights

### Performance Impact

The tracking system has minimal overhead:
- <1% CPU usage for monitoring
- Automatic data rotation (keeps last 1000 tasks)
- Efficient in-memory caching

## API Integration

For programmatic access to metrics:

```javascript
import { getPerformanceReport, getBottleneckAnalysis } from 'claude-flow/metrics';

// Get performance data
const report = await getPerformanceReport('7d');
console.log(`Success rate: ${report.summary.successRate}%`);

// Detect bottlenecks
const bottlenecks = await getBottleneckAnalysis('system');
bottlenecks.forEach(b => {
  console.log(`${b.severity}: ${b.component} - ${b.metric}`);
});
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Real-time dashboard UI
- Webhook notifications for critical bottlenecks
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Integration with external monitoring tools
- Custom metric definitions

## Privacy and Security

- All metrics are stored locally in your project
- No data is sent to external services
- Sensitive information is never logged
- Metrics can be cleared with `rm -rf .claude-flow/metrics`
