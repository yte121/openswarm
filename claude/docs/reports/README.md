# Analysis Reports and Performance Data

This directory contains various analysis reports, performance metrics, and optimization data for Claude Flow.

## Contents

### Performance Comparison Reports
JSON files containing detailed performance comparisons across different configurations:
- `comparison-analysis-mesh_*.json`: Mesh topology analysis
- `comparison-development-hierarchical_*.json`: Hierarchical development patterns
- `comparison-optimization-hybrid_*.json`: Hybrid optimization strategies
- `comparison-research-distributed_*.json`: Distributed research patterns
- `comparison-testing-distributed_*.json`: Distributed testing analysis

### Swarm Auto Reports
- `swarm-auto-centralized-*.json`: Automated centralized swarm analysis

### Swarm Optimization
The `swarm-optimization/` subdirectory contains:
- Initial analysis and findings
- Optimization recommendations
- Strategy documents
- Performance benchmarks

## Report Format

Most reports are in JSON format containing:
- Timestamp and session information
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization
- Success/failure rates
- Optimization recommendations

## Using the Reports

These reports are valuable for:
1. Performance tuning
2. Identifying bottlenecks
3. Comparing different strategies
4. Making architectural decisions
5. Tracking improvements over time

## Generating New Reports

Reports are automatically generated during:
- Performance benchmarks
- Swarm executions
- Optimization runs
- Comparison analyses

See the benchmark documentation for details on generating custom reports.
