## Usage

1. Start with `00-initial-analysis.md` for overview
2. Review specific analysis reports in `analysis/`
3. Implement recommendations from `recommendations/`
4. Use `implementations/` for code examples
5. Track progress with `benchmarks/`

## Contributing

When adding new reports:
1. Use descriptive filenames with numbering (e.g., `01-memory-analysis.md`)
2. Include executive summary and key findings
3. Provide actionable recommendations
4. Add benchmarking data where applicable
5. Update this README with new report descriptions
