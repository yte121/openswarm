## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| API Breaking Changes | High | Low | Feature flags, gradual rollout |
| Memory Regression | High | Medium | Continuous monitoring, limits |
| Event Storm | Medium | Low | Rate limiting, circuit breakers |
| Performance Regression | High | Low | A/B testing, instant rollback |

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Feature Flags**
```typescript
if (featureFlags.isEnabled('asyncExecution')) {
  return await optimizedExecutor.run(task);
} else {
  return await legacyExecutor.run(task);
}
```

2. **Gradual Rollout**
```typescript
const rolloutPercentage = config.get('rollout.percentage');
if (Math.random() * 100 < rolloutPercentage) {
  // Use new system
} else {
  // Use legacy system
}
```

3. **Instant Rollback**
```typescript
class RollbackManager {
  async rollback(): Promise<void> {
    await featureFlags.disable('all-optimizations');
    await this.restartServices();
    await this.notifyTeam();
  }
}
```
