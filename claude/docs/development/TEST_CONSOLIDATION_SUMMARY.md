# Test Directory Consolidation Summary

## Overview
Consolidated multiple test directories into a single `tests/` directory for better organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### Directory Consolidation
1. **`test/` → `tests/`**
   - Moved all content from `test/` to `tests/`
   - Included integration and migration test subdirectories

2. **`test-results/` → `tests/results/`**
   - Moved all test result files (JSON, HTML, TXT reports)
   - Preserved important test output data

3. **`test-logs/` → `tests/logs/`**
   - Moved test.log file
   - Created proper logs subdirectory

4. **`test-npm/` → `tests/npm-package/`**
   - Moved NPM package testing files
   - Better naming convention

5. **`test-sparc-init/` → `tests/sparc-init/`**
   - Moved SPARC initialization test files
   - Preserved CLAUDE.md and claude-flow files

6. **`test-dir/`**
   - Moved session data to `tests/data/sessions/test-dir/`
   - Preserved historical session metrics

### Configuration Updates
1. **`deno.json`**
   - Updated `clean` script: `test-results` → `tests/results`
   - Updated exclude paths: `test-results/` → `tests/results/`

2. **`tests/test.config.ts`**
   - Updated coverage directory: `./test-results/coverage` → `./tests/results/coverage`
   - Updated reports directory: `./test-results` → `./tests/results`
   - Updated temp directories accordingly

3. **`.gitignore`**
   - Updated test paths: `test-results/` → `tests/results/` and `tests/logs/`

4. **`scripts/test-runner.ts`**
   - Updated default output directory: `./test-results` → `./tests/results`

5. **`scripts/coverage-report.ts`**
   - Updated default coverage directory: `./test-results/coverage` → `./tests/results/coverage`
   - Updated default output directory: `./test-results` → `./tests/results`

6. **`docker-test/scripts/aggregate-test-results.js`**
   - Updated TEST_RESULTS_DIR: `/app/test-results` → `/app/tests/results`
   - Updated OUTPUT_DIR accordingly

## Final Structure
```

├── unit/              # Unit tests
├── integration/       # Integration tests (including migration tests)
├── e2e/              # End-to-end tests
├── performance/      # Performance tests
├── manual/           # Manual test procedures
├── fixtures/         # Test fixtures
├── mocks/           # Test mocks
├── utils/           # Test utilities
├── scripts/         # Test scripts
├── results/         # Test results (formerly test-results/)
├── logs/            # Test logs (formerly test-logs/)
├── npm-package/     # NPM package tests (formerly test-npm/)
├── sparc-init/      # SPARC init tests (formerly test-sparc-init/)
├── data/            # Test data including old sessions
└── migration/       # Migration tests from test/migration/
```

## Directories Not Consolidated
The following directories were intentionally NOT consolidated as they serve different purposes:
- `docker-test/` - Docker testing infrastructure
- `mcp-test-environment/` - MCP testing environment setup
- `init-test/` - Initialization testing
- `claude-flow-mcp-test/` - Specific MCP test project

## Benefits
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All tests now live under `tests/`
2. **Consistent Structure**: Clear subdirectory organization
3. **Easier Navigation**: No more scattered test directories
4. **Better CI/CD Integration**: Single directory to configure for testing
5. **Cleaner Root Directory**: Reduced clutter in project root

## Next Steps
1. Update any CI/CD pipelines that may reference old test paths
2. Update documentation that references old test directory structure
3. Verify all tests still run correctly from new locations
