# Claude-Flow MCP Wrapper - Current Status

## Summary

The Claude Code MCP wrapper has been successfully implemented and integrated, but there are multiple CLI entry points that need updating.

## What's Working

### ✅ MCP Wrapper Implementation
- The wrapper (`src/mcp/claude-code-wrapper.ts`) is fully functional
- All SPARC tools are available with automatic prompt injection
- Direct execution works perfectly:
  ```bash
  npx tsx src/mcp/claude-code-wrapper.ts
  ```

### ✅ Package.json Scripts
- `npm run mcp` uses the wrapper via `server-with-wrapper.ts`
- `npm run mcp:wrapper` runs the wrapper directly

### ✅ MCP Configuration
- `claude-flow.mcp.json` updated to use the wrapper
- Can be served with: `claude mcp serve claude-flow.mcp.json`

## What Needs Work

### ⚠️ CLI Integration
The project has multiple CLI implementations:
1. **Deno CLI** (`src/cli/main.ts`) - Primary, but Deno not available
2. **Node.js Simple CLI** (`src/cli/simple-cli.ts`) - Fallback, partially updated
3. **Compiled versions** - Out of date due to TypeScript errors

### Current Behavior
- `./claude-flow` uses the binary script which falls back to `simple-cli.ts`
- `simple-cli.ts` was updated but has a different command structure
- The `mcp start` command in simple-cli.ts doesn't match our updates

## How to Use the Wrapper Now

### Method 1: Direct Execution
```bash
npx tsx src/mcp/claude-code-wrapper.ts
```

### Method 2: NPM Scripts
```bash
npm run mcp
```

### Method 3: MCP Configuration
Add to Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "claude-flow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["node_modules/.bin/tsx", "src/mcp/server-with-wrapper.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

To fully integrate `./claude-flow mcp start`:
1. Fix TypeScript compilation errors to rebuild the project
2. Update all CLI entry points to use the wrapper
3. Ensure consistent command structure across all CLIs

## Testing the Wrapper

To verify the wrapper is working:
```bash
# Test directly
node test-wrapper-direct.js

# Test with MCP client
node test-mcp-wrapper.js
```

The wrapper provides AI-powered SPARC tools instead of template-based responses, making it much more powerful and flexible.
