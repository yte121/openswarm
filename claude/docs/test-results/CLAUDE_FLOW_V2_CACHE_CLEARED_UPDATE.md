# Claude Flow v2.0.0 - Cache Cleared Update

## 🧹 Cache Clearing Actions Taken

### NPM Cache Management
1. **Cleared NPM cache**: `npm cache clean --force` ✅
2. **Removed node_modules**: Complete removal and fresh install ✅
3. **Removed package-lock.json**: Regenerated with fresh install ✅
4. **Verified cache**: `npm cache verify` confirmed clean state ✅

### Version Conflicts Resolved
1. **Global v1.0.25 removed**: Uninstalled conflicting global version ✅
2. **Local linking**: `npm link` completed successfully ✅
3. **Version mismatch identified**: 
   - Local wrapper shows v2.0.0 for `--version`
   - But shows v1.0.25 in help text (indicating mixed versions)

## 🔍 Current State After Cache Clear

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Remote NPX execution**: `npx ruv-swarm@latest` fully functional
2. **MCP Server**: Successfully started via ruv-swarm
3. **Local wrapper**: `./claude-flow --version` correctly shows v2.0.0
4. **Swarm persistence**: Previous swarm and agents still active
5. **WASM modules**: All loaded successfully

### ❌ Build Issues Persist
- TypeScript compilation still fails with 149+ errors
- Same errors as before cache clear
- Build process blocked by type mismatches

### 📁 Directory Structure Found
```
bin/
├── claude-flow (3.4KB) - Main wrapper script
├── claude-flow-node-pkg (46MB) - Pre-compiled binary
└── Multiple swarm-related scripts

dist/
├── agents/
├── claude-code-wrapper.js
└── [20 subdirectories]
```

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Use pre-built binary**: `./bin/claude-flow-node-pkg` may work
2. **Continue with NPX**: Most reliable method currently
3. **Dev mode**: `npm run dev` for development work

### For Publishing v2.0.0
1. **Fix TypeScript errors** before npm publish
2. **Update build process** to handle type issues
3. **Test binary packaging** after successful build

## 📊 Test Results Summary

The cache clearing confirmed that:
- ✅ The v2.0.0 functionality is intact
- ✅ Remote execution works perfectly
- ✅ MCP integration is functional
- ❌ Local build issues are code-related, not cache-related
- ⚠️ Version mixing between v1.0.25 and v2.0.0 in help output

**Conclusion**: Cache was successfully cleared, but TypeScript compilation issues prevent local build. Remote NPX usage remains the recommended approach for v2.0.0 functionality.
