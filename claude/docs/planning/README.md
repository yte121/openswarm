# Planning Documents

This directory contains planning and phase documents for Claude Flow development.

## Phase Documents

1. **phase-0-research-planning.md**: Initial research and planning phase
2. **phase-1-specification.md**: Technical specifications and requirements
3. **phase-2-pseudocode.md**: Pseudocode and algorithm design
4. **phase-3-architecture.md**: System architecture and design patterns
5. **phase-4-implementation.md**: Implementation details and guidelines
6. **phase-5-deployment.md**: Deployment strategies and procedures

## Additional Plans

- `swarm.md`: Swarm orchestration planning and design

## Document Structure

Each phase document includes:
- Objectives
- Key deliverables
- Technical requirements
- Success criteria
- Timeline estimates
- Dependencies

## Workflow

The phases are designed to be executed sequentially:
1. Research and planning establishes foundation
2. Specification defines exact requirements
3. Pseudocode validates algorithms
4. Architecture ensures scalability
5. Implementation provides guidelines
6. Deployment ensures smooth releases

## Contributing

When updating planning documents:
- Maintain phase numbering consistency
- Update dependent phases if changes affect them
- Include revision history at document end
- Link to relevant implementation work
