## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### 🔴 MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:
1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message

### ⚡ GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**✅ CORRECT**: Everything in ONE message
**❌ WRONG**: Multiple messages for related operations (6x slower!)

### 🎯 CONCURRENT EXECUTION CHECKLIST:
- ✅ Are ALL related TodoWrite operations batched together?
- ✅ Are ALL Task spawning operations in ONE message?
- ✅ Are ALL file operations (Read/Write/Edit) batched together?
- ✅ Are ALL bash commands grouped in ONE message?

If ANY answer is "No", you MUST combine operations into a single message!

## Build Commands
- \`npm run build\`: Build the project
- \`npm run test\`: Run tests
- \`npm run lint\`: Run linter

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript/ES modules
- Follow project conventions
- Run typecheck before committing

## Project Info
This is a Claude-Flow AI agent orchestration system.

4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ⚡ GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Examples of CORRECT concurrent execution:**
\`\`\`javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Everything in ONE message
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 3 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Read("file1.js")
  - Read("file2.js")
  - Write("output1.js", content)
  - Write("output2.js", content)
  - Bash("npm install")
  - Bash("npm test")
  - Bash("npm run build")
\`\`\`

**Examples of WRONG sequential execution:**
\`\`\`javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Multiple messages (NEVER DO THIS)
Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Task("Agent 2")
Message 4: Read("file1.js")
Message 5: Write("output1.js")
Message 6: Bash("npm install")
// This is 6x slower and breaks coordination!

Before sending ANY message, ask yourself:
- ✅ Are ALL related TodoWrite operations batched together?
- ✅ Are ALL Task spawning operations in ONE message?
- ✅ Are ALL file operations (Read/Write/Edit) batched together?
- ✅ Are ALL bash commands grouped in ONE message?
- ✅ Are ALL memory operations concurrent?

If ANY answer is "No", you MUST combine operations into a single message!

## Project Overview
This project uses the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology for systematic Test-Driven Development with AI assistance through Claude-Flow orchestration.

## SPARC Development Commands

### Core SPARC Commands
- \`./claude-flow sparc modes\`: List all available SPARC development modes
- \`./claude-flow sparc run <mode> "<task>"\`: Execute specific SPARC mode for a task
- \`./claude-flow sparc tdd "<feature>"\`: Run complete TDD workflow using SPARC methodology
- \`./claude-flow sparc info <mode>\`: Get detailed information about a specific mode

### Standard Build Commands
- \`npm run build\`: Build the project
- \`npm run test\`: Run the test suite
- \`npm run lint\`: Run linter and format checks
- \`npm run typecheck\`: Run TypeScript type checking

## SPARC Methodology Workflow

### 1. Specification Phase
\`\`\`bash
# Create detailed specifications and requirements
./claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Define user authentication requirements"
\`\`\`
- Define clear functional requirements
- Document edge cases and constraints
- Create user stories and acceptance criteria
- Establish non-functional requirements

### 2. Pseudocode Phase
\`\`\`bash
# Develop algorithmic logic and data flows
./claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Create authentication flow pseudocode"
\`\`\`
- Break down complex logic into steps
- Define data structures and interfaces
- Plan error handling and edge cases
- Create modular, testable components

### 3. Architecture Phase
\`\`\`bash
# Design system architecture and component structure
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Design authentication service architecture"
\`\`\`
- Create system diagrams and component relationships
- Define API contracts and interfaces
- Plan database schemas and data flows
- Establish security and scalability patterns

### 4. Refinement Phase (TDD Implementation)
\`\`\`bash
# Execute Test-Driven Development cycle
./claude-flow sparc tdd "implement user authentication system"
\`\`\`

**TDD Cycle:**
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Optimize and clean up code
4. **Repeat**: Continue until feature is complete

### 5. Completion Phase
\`\`\`bash
# Integration, documentation, and validation
./claude-flow sparc run integration "integrate authentication with user management"
\`\`\`
- Integrate all components
- Perform end-to-end testing
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Validate against original requirements

- **Environment Safety**: Never hardcode secrets or environment-specific values
- **Test-First**: Always write tests before implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns, use dependency injection
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation

### Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better tooling
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Memory and State Management
- Use claude-flow memory system for persistent state across sessions
- Store progress and findings using namespaced keys
- Query previous work before starting new tasks
- Export/import memory for backup and sharing

## SPARC Memory Integration

### Memory Commands for SPARC Development
\`\`\`bash
# Store project specifications
./claude-flow memory store spec_auth "User authentication requirements and constraints"

# Store architectural decisions
./claude-flow memory store arch_decisions "Database schema and API design choices"

# Store test results and coverage
./claude-flow memory store test_coverage "Authentication module: 95% coverage, all tests passing"

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query auth_implementation

# Export project memory
./claude-flow memory export project_backup.json
\`\`\`

### Memory Namespaces

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### 🔴 MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:
1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ⚡ GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Examples of CORRECT concurrent execution:**
\`\`\`javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Everything in ONE message
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 3 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Read("file1.js")
  - Read("file2.js")
  - Write("output1.js", content)
  - Write("output2.js", content)
  - Bash("npm install")
  - Bash("npm test")
  - Bash("npm run build")
\`\`\`

**Examples of WRONG sequential execution:**
\`\`\`javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Multiple messages (NEVER DO THIS)
Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Task("Agent 2")
Message 4: Read("file1.js")
Message 5: Write("output1.js")
Message 6: Bash("npm install")
// This is 6x slower and breaks coordination!
\`\`\`

### 🎯 CONCURRENT EXECUTION CHECKLIST:

Before sending ANY message, ask yourself:
- ✅ Are ALL related TodoWrite operations batched together?
- ✅ Are ALL Task spawning operations in ONE message?
- ✅ Are ALL file operations (Read/Write/Edit) batched together?
- ✅ Are ALL bash commands grouped in ONE message?
- ✅ Are ALL memory operations concurrent?

If ANY answer is "No", you MUST combine operations into a single message!
