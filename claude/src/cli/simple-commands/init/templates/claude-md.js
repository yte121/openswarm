## üö® CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### üî¥ MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:
1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message

### ‚ö° GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**‚úÖ CORRECT**: Everything in ONE message
**‚ùå WRONG**: Multiple messages for related operations (6x slower!)

### üéØ CONCURRENT EXECUTION CHECKLIST:
- ‚úÖ Are ALL related TodoWrite operations batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL Task spawning operations in ONE message?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL file operations (Read/Write/Edit) batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL bash commands grouped in ONE message?

If ANY answer is "No", you MUST combine operations into a single message!

## Build Commands
- \`npm run build\`: Build the project
- \`npm run test\`: Run tests
- \`npm run lint\`: Run linter

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript/ES modules
- Follow project conventions
- Run typecheck before committing

Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Task("Agent 2")
Message 4: Read("file1.js")
Message 5: Write("output1.js")

## SPARC Methodology Workflow

### 1. Specification Phase
\`\`\`bash
# Create detailed specifications and requirements
./claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Define user authentication requirements"
\`\`\`
- Define clear functional requirements
- Document edge cases and constraints
- Create user stories and acceptance criteria
- Establish non-functional requirements

### 2. Pseudocode Phase
\`\`\`bash
# Develop algorithmic logic and data flows
./claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Create authentication flow pseudocode"
\`\`\`
- Break down complex logic into steps
- Define data structures and interfaces
- Plan error handling and edge cases
- Create modular, testable components

### 3. Architecture Phase
\`\`\`bash
# Design system architecture and component structure
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Design authentication service architecture"
\`\`\`

- Plan database schemas and data flows
- Establish security and scalability patterns

### 4. Refinement Phase (TDD Implementation)
\`\`\`bash
# Execute Test-Driven Development cycle
./claude-flow sparc tdd "implement user authentication system"
\`\`\`

**TDD Cycle:**
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Optimize and clean up code
4. **Repeat**: Continue until feature is complete

## üö® CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### üî¥ MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:
1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ‚ö° GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Examples of CORRECT concurrent execution:**
\`\`\`javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Everything in ONE message
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 3 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Read("file1.js")
  - Read("file2.js")
  - Write("output1.js", content)
  - Write("output2.js", content)
  - Bash("npm install")
  - Bash("npm test")
  - Bash("npm run build")
\`\`\`

**Examples of WRONG sequential execution:**
\`\`\`javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Multiple messages (NEVER DO THIS)
Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Task("Agent 2")
Message 4: Read("file1.js")
Message 5: Write("output1.js")
Message 6: Bash("npm install")
// This is 6x slower and breaks coordination!
\`\`\`

### üéØ CONCURRENT EXECUTION CHECKLIST:

Before sending ANY message, ask yourself:
- ‚úÖ Are ALL related TodoWrite operations batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL Task spawning operations in ONE message?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL file operations (Read/Write/Edit) batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL bash commands grouped in ONE message?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL memory operations concurrent?

If ANY answer is "No", you MUST combine operations into a single message!
