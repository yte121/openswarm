function createTaskTracking(): string {
  return `# Task Tracking Format for Swarm Operations

## Overview
Swarm operations use a standardized task tracking format to provide clear visibility into progress, priorities, and dependencies across all agents.

## Progress Overview Display

The swarm coordinator will display task progress using this format:

\`\`\`
📊 Progress Overview
   ├── Total Tasks: 12
   ├── ✅ Completed: 8 (67%)
   ├── 🔄 In Progress: 2 (17%)
   ├── ⭕ Todo: 1 (8%)
   └── ❌ Blocked: 1 (8%)
\`\`\`

## Task Lists by Status

### 📋 Todo Tasks
Tasks waiting to be started:
\`\`\`
📋 Todo (1)
   └── 🔴 001: Set up authentication system [HIGH] ▶
\`\`\`

### 🔄 In Progress Tasks
Tasks currently being worked on:
\`\`\`
🔄 In progress (2)
   ├── 🟡 002: Implement user dashboard ↳ 1 deps ▶
   └── 🔴 003: Add payment integration [CRITICAL] ▶
\`\`\`

### ✅ Completed Tasks
Tasks that have been finished:
\`\`\`
✅ Completed (8)
   ├── ✅ 004: Design wireframes
   ├── ✅ 005: Set up database schema
   ├── ✅ 006: Create API endpoints
   └── ... (more completed tasks)
\`\`\`

### ❌ Blocked Tasks
Tasks that cannot proceed due to dependencies:
\`\`\`
❌ Blocked (1)
   └── 🔴 007: Deploy to production ↳ 3 deps [BLOCKED]
\`\`\`

## Priority Indicators

Tasks use color-coded priority indicators:
- 🔴 **HIGH/CRITICAL**: Urgent tasks requiring immediate attention
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Important tasks that should be addressed soon
- 🟢 **LOW**: Tasks that can be deferred if needed

## Special Notations

### Dependencies
- \`↳ X deps\`: Indicates the task depends on X other tasks
- Tasks with dependencies show the count after the task description

### Action Indicators
- \`▶\`: Indicates an actionable task that can be started
- \`[BLOCKED]\`: Task cannot proceed until dependencies are resolved
- \`[PRIORITY]\`: Explicit priority level (HIGH, CRITICAL, etc.)

## Usage in Swarm Operations

### TodoWrite Integration
When creating tasks with TodoWrite, include priority and dependency information:
\`\`\`javascript
TodoWrite([
  {
    id: "auth_001",
    content: "Set up authentication system",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "high",
    dependencies: []
  },
  {
    id: "dashboard_002",
    content: "Implement user dashboard",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "medium",
    dependencies: ["auth_001"]
  },
  {
    id: "payment_003",
    content: "Add payment integration",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "critical",
    dependencies: []
  }
]);
\`\`\`

### Real-time Updates
The swarm coordinator will:
1. Update task statuses as agents progress
2. Recalculate percentages automatically
3. Move tasks between categories based on status
4. Show dependency resolution in real-time

## Best Practices

### Task Organization
- Group related tasks together
- Use clear, actionable task descriptions
- Set realistic priorities based on business value
- Define dependencies explicitly

### Progress Monitoring
- Check progress overview regularly
- Focus on unblocking blocked tasks
- Prioritize high/critical items
- Balance workload across agents

### Status Management
- Update task status immediately when starting work
- Mark tasks complete as soon as finished
- Document blockers when they occur
- Use Memory to store progress details
