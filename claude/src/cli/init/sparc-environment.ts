This CLAUDE.md file configures Claude Code to help you BUILD YOUR OWN APPLICATIONS using the claude-flow orchestration system. Claude-flow is a tool to help you develop software - it is NOT the project you should be modifying.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Use claude-flow commands to BUILD YOUR APPLICATION
- DO NOT modify the claude-flow system itself
- Focus on YOUR PROJECT'S code, not the orchestration tool

## üìÅ Project Structure

## üõ†Ô∏è How Claude Code Helps Build YOUR Application

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Development Assistance
When you use claude-flow commands, Claude Code will help you:
- **Write code** for YOUR application (not for claude-flow itself)
- **Design architecture** for YOUR project requirements
- **Create tests** for YOUR features
- **Debug issues** in YOUR code
- **Optimize performance** of YOUR application
- **Document** YOUR project

### üìã Task Management for YOUR Project
Claude Code uses TodoWrite and TodoRead to manage YOUR development tasks:

\`\`\`javascript
// Example: Claude Code will create tasks for YOUR application development
TodoWrite([
  {
    id: "create_user_model",
    content: "Create User model for YOUR application",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    id: "implement_auth", 
    content: "Implement authentication for YOUR app",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    id: "add_user_dashboard",
    content: "Create user dashboard for YOUR application",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "medium"
  },
  {
    id: "write_tests",
    content: "Write tests for YOUR new features",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "high"
  }
]);
\`\`\`

## üéØ SPARC Modes: Specialized AI Assistants for Your Project

Each SPARC mode is a specialized AI assistant that helps with different aspects of YOUR application development:

### üë®‚Äçüíª Development Modes
- **coder**: Writes code for YOUR application features
- **architect**: Designs YOUR system architecture and database schemas
- **tdd**: Helps you build YOUR features with test-driven development
- **designer**: Creates UI/UX designs for YOUR application

### üîç Analysis & Research Modes
- **researcher**: Researches best practices for YOUR project needs
- **analyzer**: Analyzes YOUR code for improvements

- **innovator**: Suggests innovative features for YOUR application

## üêù Swarm Mode: Multiple AI Agents for Complex Features

Use swarm mode when building complex features that benefit from multiple specialized agents:

\`\`\`bash
# Example: Building a complete e-commerce platform
./claude-flow swarm "Build complete e-commerce platform with payment integration" \\
  --strategy development --parallel --max-agents 8

# Example: Adding real-time features to YOUR app
./claude-flow swarm "Add real-time chat and notifications to my app" \\
  --strategy development --parallel --max-agents 5

# Example: Comprehensive testing of YOUR application
./claude-flow swarm "Create comprehensive test suite for my API" \\
  --strategy testing --parallel --max-agents 6
\`\`\`

## üíª Code Style for YOUR Project

When Claude Code writes code for YOUR application, it will follow these best practices:
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript/TypeScript
- Clean, readable code with proper naming
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization
- Proper documentation

## üö® Important Reminders

### ‚úÖ DO Use Claude-Flow For:
- Building YOUR new application
- Adding features to YOUR project
- Writing tests for YOUR code
- Debugging YOUR application
- Optimizing YOUR performance
- Documenting YOUR project

### ‚ùå DON'T Use Claude-Flow For:
- Modifying the claude-flow system itself

- Fixing claude-flow bugs (report them on GitHub instead)

## üéâ Get Started Building YOUR Application!

Remember: Claude-flow is a TOOL to help you build YOUR application faster and better. Focus on describing what YOU want to build, and let the AI agents help you create it.

**Example first command for a new project:**
\`\`\`bash
./claude-flow sparc "Create a [YOUR APP TYPE] application with [YOUR MAIN FEATURES]"
\`\`\`

Happy coding! üöÄ
